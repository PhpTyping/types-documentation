This is the documentation repo for php-typing/types.

The documentation has 2 deployment targets, one on GH pages, and one on RTD.

They both build from the same branch so they should be the same. If one link doesn't work
feel free to try the other.

[Follow this link for the live documentation][documentation link].

[Alternatively hosted on RTD](https://php-types.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
