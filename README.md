This is the documentation repo for php-typing/types.

The documentation has 2 deployment targets, one on GH pages, and one on RTD.

They both build from the same branch, so they have the same content.
If one link doesn't work feel free to try the other.

[Follow this link for the live documentation][doc link].

[Alternatively hosted on RTD][rtd docs].
